# nm-coding-challenge
For this coding challenge, I am building a ReactJS Restaurant Recommendation web application that fetches API data from the Yelp Fusion API. This lightweight tool will allow a user to input a desired food/cuisine, and search by the desired location. The application will return the results of the top 20 restaurants recommended by Yelp.
