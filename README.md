# nm-coding-challenge
For this coding challenge, I am building a ReactJS Restaurant Recommendation web application that fetches API data from the Yelp Fusion API. This lightweight tool will allow a user to input a desired food/cuisine, and search by the desired location. The application will return the results of the top 20 restaurants recommended by Yelp.

Right now, I'm experiencing a rendering issue. After some research, I realize that React Router has upgraded to v6 a few days ago. There is a powerful new Routes element which is a significant upgrade from the Switch element. I will try to resolve before the deadline. The production is deployed, and published at this Netlify URL https://compassionate-allen-e640d8.netlify.app/
